## Requirements

Before you deploy, you must have the following installed on your device:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) _(v2.0.0+ required)_
- [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html) _(v2.1022.0+ required)_
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) _(v10.0.0+ required)_
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) _(v22.7.9+ required)_
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) _(v3.12+ required)_

### Request Higher Bedrock LLM Invocation Quotas

For optimal performance, it is recommended to request higher invocation quotas for Bedrock LLM models before deployment. The default quotas may be insufficient for processing concurrent requests or high-volume usage.

For detailed information about Bedrock service quotas, see the [AWS Bedrock Service Quotas documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock).

To request quota increases:

1. Navigate to the **AWS Service Quotas** console in your AWS account
2. Search for "Bedrock" in the service quotas
3. Select the relevant LLM models you plan to use:
   - Meta Llama 3 70B Instruct
   - Cohere Embed V4
4. Request quota increases for "Requests per minute" based on your expected usage
5. Submit the quota increase request and wait for AWS approval (this can take 24-48 hours)

_Note: Consider your expected concurrent users and document processing volume when requesting quota increases. Higher quotas ensure smoother operations without throttling._

## Pre-Deployment

### Create GitHub Personal Access Token

To deploy this solution, you will need to generate a GitHub personal access token. Please visit [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) for detailed instruction to create a personal access token.

_Note: Make sure to give access to only OER-AI repository. Enable Read-only for Contents, and Metadata. For webhooks and Commit statuses enable read and write permissions._

**Once you create a token, please note down its value as you will use it later in the deployment process.**

## Deployment

### Step 1: Fork & Clone The Repository

First, you need to fork the repository. To create a fork, navigate to the main branch of this repository. Then, in the top-right corner, click `Fork`.

You will be directed to the page where you can customize owner, repository name, etc, but you do not have to change any option. Simply click `Create fork` in the bottom right corner.

Now let's clone the GitHub repository onto your machine. To do this:

1. Create a folder on your computer to contain the project code.
2. For an Apple computer, open Terminal. If on a Windows machine, open Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. Enter into the folder you made using the command `cd path/to/folder`. To find the path to a folder on a Mac, right click on the folder and press `Get Info`, then select the whole text found under `Where:` and copy with ⌘C. On Windows (not WSL), enter into the folder on File Explorer and click on the path box (located to the left of the search bar), then copy the whole text that shows up.
3. Clone the GitHub repository by entering the following command. Be sure to replace `<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>` with your own username.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/OER-AI
```

The code should now be in the folder you created. Navigate into the root folder containing the entire codebase by running the command:

```bash
cd OER-AI
```

#### Install Dependencies

Go into the cdk folder which can be done with the following command:

```bash
cd cdk
```

Now that you are in the cdk directory, install the core dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Go into the frontend folder which can be done with the following command:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Now that you are in the frontend directory, install the core dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Upload Secrets

You would have to supply your GitHub personal access token you created earlier when deploying the solution. Run the following command and ensure you replace `<YOUR-GITHUB-TOKEN>` and `<YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>` with your actual GitHub token and the appropriate AWS profile name.

<details>
<summary>macOS/Linux</summary>

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name github-personal-access-token \
  --secret-string '{"my-github-token": "<YOUR-GITHUB-TOKEN>"}' \
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows CMD</summary>

```cmd
aws secretsmanager create-secret ^
  --name github-personal-access-token ^
  --secret-string "{\"my-github-token\": \"<YOUR-GITHUB-TOKEN>\"}" ^
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>PowerShell</summary>

```powershell
aws secretsmanager create-secret `
  --name github-personal-access-token `
  --secret-string '{\"my-github-token\": \"<YOUR-GITHUB-TOKEN>\"}' `
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

&nbsp;

Moreover, you will need to upload your GitHub username to Amazon SSM Parameter Store. You can do so by running the following command. Make sure you replace `<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>` and `<YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>` with your actual username and the appropriate AWS profile name.

<details>
<summary>macOS/Linux</summary>

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name "oer-owner-name" \
  --value "<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>" \
  --type String \
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows CMD</summary>

```cmd
aws ssm put-parameter ^
  --name "oer-owner-name" ^
  --value "<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>" ^
  --type String ^
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>PowerShell</summary>

```powershell
aws ssm put-parameter `
  --name "oer-owner-name" `
  --value "<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>" `
  --type String `
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

&nbsp;

You would have to supply a custom database username when deploying the solution to increase security. Run the following command and ensure you replace `<YOUR-DB-USERNAME>` with the custom name of your choice.

<details>
<summary>macOS/Linux</summary>

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name OERSecrets \
  --secret-string "{\"DB_Username\":\"<YOUR-DB-USERNAME>\"}" \
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows CMD</summary>

```cmd
aws secretsmanager create-secret ^
  --name OERSecrets ^
  --secret-string "{\"DB_Username\":\"<YOUR-DB-USERNAME>\"}" ^
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>PowerShell</summary>

```powershell
aws secretsmanager create-secret `
  --name OERSecrets `
  --secret-string '{\"DB_Username\": \"<YOUR-DB-USERNAME>\"}' `
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

&nbsp;

For example:

```bash
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name OERSecrets \
  --secret-string '{"DB_Username":"OERDatabaseUser"}' \
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

Finally, in order to restrict user sign up to specific email domains, you will need to upload a comma separated list of allowed email domains to Amazon SSM Parameter Store. You can do so by running the following command. Make sure you replace `<YOUR-ALLOWED-EMAIL-DOMAIN-LIST>` and `<YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>` with your actual list and the appropriate AWS profile name.

<details>
<summary>macOS/Linux</summary>

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/OER/AllowedEmailDomains" \
    --value "<YOUR-ALLOWED-EMAIL-DOMAIN-LIST>" \
    --type SecureString \
    --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows CMD</summary>

```cmd
aws ssm put-parameter ^
    --name "/OER/AllowedEmailDomains" ^
    --value "<YOUR-ALLOWED-EMAIL-DOMAIN-LIST>" ^
    --type SecureString ^
    --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>PowerShell</summary>

```powershell
aws ssm put-parameter `
    --name "/OER/AllowedEmailDomains" `
    --value "<YOUR-ALLOWED-EMAIL-DOMAIN-LIST>" `
    --type SecureString `
    --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

</details>

&nbsp;

For example, an email domain list we recommend is:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name "/OER/AllowedEmailDomains" \
    --value "gmail.com,ubc.ca,student.ubc.ca" \
    --type SecureString \
    --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

### Step 3: CDK Deployment

It's time to set up everything that goes on behind the scenes! For more information on how the backend works, feel free to refer to the Architecture documentation, but an understanding of the backend is not necessary for deployment.

If you are new to CDK, note that the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) lets you define cloud infrastructure using code. Review the [AWS CDK Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/) for a quick primer before proceeding.

Note: Guardrails (Bedrock) are created as part of the CDK deployment. For operational guidance and advanced customization of guardrails and Bedrock configuration, see `Docs/BEDROCK_GUARDRAILS.md`.

Open a terminal in the `/cdk` directory.

**Initialize the CDK stack** (required only if you have not deployed any resources with CDK in this region before). Please replace `<YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>` with the appropriate AWS profile used earlier.

```bash
cdk synth --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME> --context githubRepo=OER-AI
cdk bootstrap aws://<YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>/<YOUR_ACCOUNT_REGION> --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME> --context githubRepo=OER-AI
```

**Deploy CDK stack**

You may run the following command to deploy the stacks all at once. Again, replace `<YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>` with the appropriate AWS profile used earlier. Also replace `<YOUR-STACK-PREFIX>` with the appropriate stack prefix. It is recommended to make your stack prefix at most 6 characters long to avoid hitting the character limit.

The stack prefix will be prefixed onto the physical names of the resources created during deployment. The `environment` parameter specifies the deployment environment (dev, test, prod), the `version` parameter indicates the application version being deployed, and the `githubRepo` parameter should match your forked repository name.

```bash
cdk deploy --all \
  --context StackPrefix=<YOUR-STACK-PREFIX> \
  --context environment=dev \
  --context version=1.0.0 \
  --context githubRepo=OER-AI \
  --profile <YOUR-PROFILE-NAME>
```

For example:

```bash
cdk deploy --all \
  --context StackPrefix=OER \
  --context environment=dev \
  --context version=1.0.0 \
  --context githubRepo=OER-AI \
  --profile my-aws-profile
```

**Note:** The deployment process may take 15-30 minutes to complete. You will be prompted to approve IAM changes and security group modifications during deployment.

### CodePipeline & ECR Image Bootstrapping (First-Time Deployment)

During the first-time deployment of the API stack, the deployment may fail because the required Docker images for Lambda functions have not yet been built and pushed to ECR. This happens because CodePipeline/CodeBuild is responsible for creating the ECR repositories and building the images, but these processes are not completed before the stack attempts to reference the images.

To resolve this issue, follow one of these approaches:

### Authorize GitHub Connection for CI/CD

After CDK deployment, the GitHub connection for CodePipeline is created in a **pending** state. You must manually authorize it:

1. Navigate to **AWS Console** → **Code Pipeline** → **Developer Tools** → **Settings** → **Connections**
   
2. Find the connection named `<STACK-PREFIX>-CICD-github-connection`
3. The status will show **Pending** - click on the connection name
4. Click **Update pending connection**
5. A GitHub authorization window will appear - click **Authorize AWS Connector for GitHub**
6. Select the GitHub account/organization and grant access to the OER-AI repository
7. Click **Install & Authorize**
8. The connection status should now show **Available**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CI/CD pipeline will not be able to pull source code from GitHub until this connection is authorized. If you skip this step, pipeline runs will fail at the Source stage.

#### Manually Trigger the Pipeline Build (Recommended):

1. Go to the AWS Console → CodePipeline → select your pipeline `<STACK-PREFIX>-pipeline` → click `Release change` or `Start pipeline`.
2. Wait for the Pipeline to complete the build and push the required Docker images to ECR.
3. Once the images are available, redeploy the API stack to ensure the Lambdas can reference the images.

**Notes:**

- Verify the ECR repository names and tags in the AWS Console or CDK outputs to ensure they match the expected values.
- After the pipeline successfully completes and the images are pushed, the API stack should deploy successfully.

**Troubleshooting:**

- Check the CodePipeline and CodeBuild logs for any errors during the build process.
- Verify that the required images and tags are present in ECR.
- Ensure that the IAM roles for CodePipeline and CodeBuild have the necessary permissions to push images to ECR.


## Post-Deployment

### Step 1: Build AWS Amplify App

1. Log in to AWS console, and navigate to **AWS Amplify**. You can do so by typing `Amplify` in the search bar at the top.
2. From `All apps`, click `<STACK-PREFIX>-amplify`.
3. You will see multiple branches listed (`main`, `dev`, `api_endpoint_setup`). Click on the branch that corresponds to your GitHub repository's default branch (typically `main`).
4. Click `Redeploy this version` to trigger a build
5. Wait for the build to complete (this may take 5-10 minutes)
6. You now have access to the `Amplify App ID` and the public domain name to use the web app.

### Step 2: Configure Admin User

To create an admin user for accessing the admin dashboard:

1. Navigate to **AWS Cognito** in the AWS Console
2. Find the User Pool named `<STACK-PREFIX>-UserPool`
3. Click on "Users" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Create user"
5. Fill in the required information:
   - Username: your email address
   - Email: same as username
   - Temporary password: create a secure password
6. Click "Don't send an email invitation"
7. Click "Create user"
8. After creation, select the user and click "Add user to group"
9. Select the "admin" group
10. On first login, you'll be prompted to change your password

### Step 3: Visit Web App

You can now navigate to the web app URL (found in the Amplify console) to see your application in action.

**Default URL format:** `https://main.<app-id>.amplifyapp.com`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: CDK deployment fails with "Resource already exists"**

- Solution: Check if you have existing resources with the same names. Either delete them or use a different stack prefix.

**Issue: CloudFormation validation error during ResourceExistenceCheck referencing DataPipeline or CICD ARNs**

- Symptoms: CloudFormation throws a validation error during the change set or deployment phase, related to a `ResourceExistenceCheck` for an ARN that appears to reference the `DataPipeline` or `CICD` resources.
- Solution: This commonly occurs on first-time deployments when the pipeline and ECR resources are created by the deployment but are referenced in IAM policy statements before they exist. Follow the [CodePipeline & ECR Image Bootstrapping](#codepipeline--ecr-image-bootstrapping-first-time-deployment) steps to manually trigger the pipeline build and redeploy.

**Issue: Amplify build fails**

- Solution: Check the build logs in Amplify console. Common causes:
  - Missing environment variables
  - Node version mismatch
  - Dependency installation failures

**Issue: Database connection errors**

- Solution: Verify that:
  - RDS instance is running
  - Security groups allow Lambda to access RDS
  - Database credentials are correct in Secrets Manager

**Issue: CORS errors in browser**

- Solution: Verify that the API Gateway CORS configuration includes your Amplify domain

**Issue: WebSocket connection fails**

- Solution: Check that:
  - WebSocket API is deployed
  - Lambda functions have correct permissions
  - Frontend is using the correct WebSocket URL

**Issue: [ON FIRST RUN] Chatbot responds with "I'm experiencing technical difficulties and cannot process your request at this time"**

- Solution:
  - Most likely, this is a guardrail issue. Double check the CloudWatch logs for the Text Generation Lambda function.
  - Make sure the guardrail can be found. Even if it's created and shows status "Ready", make sure you create a versioned release from the working draft (eg: version 1) instead of using the DRAFT version.

## Cleanup

### Taking down the deployed stack

To take down the deployed stack for a fresh redeployment in the future, follow these steps in order:

1. **Disable RDS Deletion Protection:**
   - Navigate to **Amazon RDS** in the AWS Console
   - Click on "Databases" in the left sidebar
   - Select the database instance named `<STACK-PREFIX>-database`
   - Click "Modify"
   - Scroll down to "Deletion protection" and uncheck the box
   - Click "Continue" and then "Modify DB instance"
   - Wait for the modification to complete before proceeding

2. **Delete CloudFormation Stacks:**
   Navigate to AWS CloudFormation console and delete stacks in this order:
   - `<STACK-PREFIX>-Amplify`
   - `<STACK-PREFIX>-CICD`
   - `<STACK-PREFIX>-Api`
   - `<STACK-PREFIX>-DataPipeline`
   - `<STACK-PREFIX>-DBFlow`
   - `<STACK-PREFIX>-Database`
   - `<STACK-PREFIX>-VpcStack`

3. **Delete Secrets:**
   - Navigate to AWS Secrets Manager
   - Delete the following secrets:
     - `github-personal-access-token`
     - `OERSecrets`
     - Any database credentials created by the stack

4. **Delete SSM Parameters:**
   - Navigate to AWS Systems Manager → Parameter Store
   - Delete the following parameters:
     - `oer-owner-name`
     - `/OER/AllowedEmailDomains`
     - Any other parameters created by the stack

5. **Delete ECR Repositories** (if any were created):
   - Navigate to Amazon ECR
   - Delete repositories created by the stack

6. **Verify Cleanup**:
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for any remaining log groups
   - Check Lambda functions for any remaining functions
   - Check API Gateway for any remaining APIs

**Note:** Please wait for each stack to be properly deleted before deleting the next stack. Some resources have dependencies that must be removed first.

**Cost Warning:** Ensure all resources are deleted to avoid ongoing charges. Pay special attention to:

- RDS instances
- NAT Gateways
- Elastic IPs
- S3 storage
- CloudWatch Logs retention
