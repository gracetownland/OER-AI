---

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

Troubleshooting tips:
- If the frontend cannot reach the backend, verify your `VITE_API_ENDPOINT` setting and Amplify configuration.
- For audio issues, check browser permissions and the selected voice.
- If H5P export fails, check the API logs and ensure the packaging backend is reachable.
- For WebSocket (chat streaming) issues, inspect the browser console for WebSocket endpoints and network errors.

Best practices:
- Be specific with user questions and include a textbook section or page reference to improve source relevance.
- Use the Prompt Library and Guided Prompts to generate repeatable, reproducible prompts.
- Avoid sharing personally identifiable or sensitive information in public shared chat links.
- Export practice sets to H5P or PDF if you require persistent content beyond the session (session data persists for ~30 days).
